# Business-plan


In Fall 2021, I worked on a 10-person team to develop a business plan for a potential startup. This plan would look at a start up's lifecyle from product development all the way to end of life to it's terminal value. Our plan was divided up into 4 sections: operations, marketing, finance, and risk management. Working on the project I was the sub team leader for our finance and operation sections where I was responsible to help create material, communicate deadlines, and monitor our work. Furthermore, I was in charge of designing our product and marketing materials using CAD, photoshop, 3D printers, and a laser cutter.
