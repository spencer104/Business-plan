Business plan 

For Fall 2021 I worked on a 10-person team to develop a business plan from product development all the way to end of life cycle. Our plan was divided up into 4 sections operations, marketing, finance, and risk management. Working on the project I was the sub team leader for our finance and operation sections.  I was responsible to help create material, communicate deadlines, and monitor our work. Not only was I a team leader I help prototype a model of our product and marketing materials using CAD, photoshop, 3D printing, and laser cutting.
